# Raw Output - Vision and Concept

Raw Output is a score tracker for the **Viscose Benchmarks** that prioritize long-term consistency over peak performances. It seeks to better reflect consistency in aim, while being designed to encourage healthy improvement.

The name "Raw Output" is a direct nod to the **Raw Input** aim group [todo add link to Raw Input].

## Value Proposition

1.  **Rewarding Consistency**: Highscores can be binary and discouraging during plateaus. Raw Output uses a rank-decay system to visualize "rust" and allow skill maintenance to feel less discouraging.
2.  **Targeting Weaknesses**: Selects weaker scenarios to encourage player improvement.

## Target Audience

-   **Benchmark Players**: Players who want to chase scores on benchmarks, but who also intend to use that as practice.
-   **Consistency-Focused Players**: Players who find traditional "high-score only" systems to be discouraging or non-representative of their actual skill level.
