# Current Checkpoint

## Phase 4: Ranked Runs (Checkpoint 4.3 - Rank Estimator & Prediction Math)

### Objective
Enhance the rank estimation logic with predictive math, better weighting for scenario performance, and refining the transition between tiers.

### Progress
- [x] Create Ranked Mechanics Design Document
- [x] Implement enhanced prediction math in `RankEstimator` (Decay, Ranks, EMA)
- [x] Refine weighting for balanced vs. focused performance (Hierarchical Aggregation)
- [x] Integrate Ranked Math and Deterministic Selection into UI
- [x] Refine Ranked UI Aesthetics (Font scaling, Button consolidation)

**Next Step:** Commit and proceed to Phase 4.4 if applicable.
