# Current Checkpoint: 2.13.2: Scroll Track Cut-out

## Status
Completed

## Deliverables
- Stationary glass background layer for the benchmark table container.
- Implementation of a "cut-out" effect for the scroll track using inverted box-shadows.
- Fixed-height (2rem) tactile scroll thumb with dual-layer inset shadows.
- Synchronized custom drag logic to maintain 1:1 mouse tracking.
- "Hover-to-scroll" behavior on the top and bottom 10% of the thumb.

## Summary
The benchmark table now features a unique, tactile scroll track. By using an inverted mask for the track and a custom-rendered thumb, we've achieved a "glass cut-out" look that remains responsive to both native dragging and a new automated hover-scroll interaction.
