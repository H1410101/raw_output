```# Current Checkpoint: 2.16.2: Lazy Dot Cloud Synchronization

## Status
Completed

## Deliverables
- [x] Implement explicit disposal and container sanitization for `DotCloudComponent`.
- [x] Add redraw batching logic to prevent redundant frames during setting updates.
- [x] Refactor `DotCloudCanvasRenderer` to use a captured `RenderContext` for frame consistency.
- [x] Ensure high-priority redraws on `HistoryService` data ingestion.
- [x] Fix stale highlight artifacts when the "latest run" state transitions between sessions.
