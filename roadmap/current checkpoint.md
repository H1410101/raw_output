# Current Checkpoint: 2.11: Session Interval Settings

## Status
In Progress

## Deliverables
- Configurable session timeout logic.
- UI setting for inactivity interval.
- Session statistics filtering based on the defined interval.

## Summary
This checkpoint introduces the ability for users to define what constitutes a "session" via an inactivity timeout. The system will use this setting to determine if the most recent runs should be grouped into the current active session or if they belong to a historical one, ensuring the "Live Session" data remains relevant to the user's current training block.
