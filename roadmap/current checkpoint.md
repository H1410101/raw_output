# Current Checkpoint: 2.16.14: Reactive Title Glow

## Status
Done

## Deliverables
- [x] Implement a subtle glow shadow behind the "Raw Output" title.
- [x] Integrate the glow with the dynamic ripple system so it only appears when ripples pass through.
- [x] Ensure the glow logic matches the dynamic background/dot grid behavior.
