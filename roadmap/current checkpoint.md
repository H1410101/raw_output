# Current Checkpoint: 2.14.1: Background Dynamics

## Status
Done

## Deliverables
- A global "dot grid" background (10rem spacing) with 0.05rem blur.
- Multiple overlapping "opacity ripples" with sharp borders.
- Slower, multi-directional ripple movement (90s-140s cycles).
- Depth interaction via backdrop-filter on foreground panels.

## Summary
Adding depth and movement to the application's background to reinforce the new visual identity. The background dynamics will provide a subtle, non-distracting layer of polish that interacts with the foreground elements.
