# Current Checkpoint: 2.8: Visualization & Fluid Typography

## Status
Done

## Deliverables
- Micro-chart visualization (Strip Plot) for the last 100 plays.
- Global CSS variable system for fluid typography.
- Calculated clamp-based font scaling for all UI elements.

## Summary
This checkpoint introduces the "Dot Cloud" visualization for performance density analysis and a fluid typography system. The Dot Cloud plots the last 100 recorded scores as semi-transparent dots for each scenario. To support the increased UI density across resolutions, a CSS `clamp()` based font scaling system ensures legibility from 1080p to 4K environments.
