# Current Checkpoint: 2.14.2: Scroll Track Cut-out

## Status
Completed

## Deliverables
- Stationary glass background layer for the benchmark table container.
- Implementation of a "cut-out" effect for the scroll track using inverted box-shadows.
- Rounded geometry for the scroll track hole to match scroll thumb aesthetics.
- Removal of redundant background colors on individual benchmark rows/categories.

## Summary
The benchmark table now features a refined "cut-out" scroll track. By using a stationary pseudo-element with a massive spread shadow, we've created a persistent glass tint that avoids the scroll track area, providing a more professional and integrated "glassmorphism" look.
