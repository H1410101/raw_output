# Current Checkpoint: 2.12: Inter-session Behaviour

## Status
Completed

## Deliverables
- Persistent application settings (Visual Settings, Session Interval).
- Persistent UI state (Last selected difficulty, Popups/Menus state).
- Consistent restoration of app state across restarts/refreshes.

## Summary
The goal is to ensure that all user preferences and UI state are saved locally, providing a seamless experience where the application returns to its exact previous state upon being reopened.
